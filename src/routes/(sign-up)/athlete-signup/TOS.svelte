	DapUp’s method of operations: Participating Businesses create and send Campaigns through the
	Platform located on the DapUp website, which oﬀer Athletes the opportunity to participate in
	Campaigns from a Business. DapUp presents this information to eligible Athletes on the platform
	for Athletes to indicate whether such FEC/49697.0001/10191431 Campaign is one they would like to
	pursue. Each Campaign details a brief description of the Campaign, deliverables, a start and end
	date, compensation information, and any exclusivity requirements. If accepted to the Campaign,
	participating Athletes will receive additional information and Guidelines from DapUp via email
	communications and through Athlete’s account in the Platform. All Campaigns must comply with the
	requirements established by DapUp (referred to as the “Requirements”). By accepting and
	participating in a Campaign, You acknowledge the terms of the Campaign and agree to be connected
	that You have reviewed and accept all Requirements and that You agree to strictly adhere to the
	Campaign, the Requirements, and this Agreement. Permanence of Content: All content created or
	published for any Campaign will remain publicly visible with the campaign hashtag(s) and
	disclosures for a period of at least 90 days after the final payment of Fees. In addition, if
	the Content is modified in any way beyond this time period, the required disclosure must remain
	intact in order to comply with FTC requirements. Reporting: The outcomes of all connections
	between Businesses and Athletes must be reported within 2 hours of Athlete receiving
	compensation, and failure to timely report will result in potential payment deduction of fifty
	dollars ($25.00) in compensation for each day delay in submission. During the term of this
	Agreement, Athlete has the right to provide content services to others provided that such other
	engagement or performance does not: (a) interfere in any way with the timely and professional
	performance of the Services to DapUp; (b) require the disclosure or use of Confidential
	Information; and (c) conflict with any other agreements between DapUp and Athlete regarding
	exclusivity. DapUp has no obligation to propose a Campaign to Athlete and may receive content
	services from other Athletes during the term of this Agreement. If You do not accept the
	Requirements, You must immediately notify DapUp and refrain from participating in the Campaign.
	Noncompliance with the Requirements, including but not limited to any applicable acceptance or
	posting dates, or this Agreement may result in Athlete not being entitled to compensation,
	removal from the Campaign, ineligibility to participate in any future DapUp Campaigns and/or
	being removed from the DapUp Platform.

	a separate written agreement, nothing in this Agreement gives You a right to use any of DapUp´s
	or its Business’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other
	distinctive brand features. If You have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand
	features in a separate written agreement with DapUp, then You agree that Your use of such
	features shall be in compliance with that agreement. Unless You have been expressly authorized
	to do so in writing by DapUp, You agree that You will not use any trademark, service mark, trade
	name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion
	about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos. If DapUp makes any Business
	names, logos, trademarks, product images or other Business materials (“Business Materials”)
	available for Your use in connection with a Campaign, then subject to the terms and conditions
	provided to Athlete by DapUp or Business, Business grants Athlete a non- exclusive, revocable,
	non-transferable right to use the Business Materials only pursuant to those terms and conditions
	and this FEC/49697.0001/10191431 Agreement and only for purposes of the Campaign. Athlete
	understands that as to the Business Materials Athlete may not use them in a manner that suggests
	any endorsement of Athlete or Athlete’s website/blog/social media sites or other sites or
	services. Athlete understands that the license to the Business Materials will automatically
	terminate if Athlete exceeds the scope of the license or violates any of the terms and
	conditions hereunder, and that Athlete will then be subject to copyright infringement and
	potentially other liability. If any Business Materials are provided to Athlete with any
	disclosure or confidentiality obligations (e.g., no mention until a certain date), Athlete will
	strictly comply with such obligations. All Athlete Content will belong exclusively to DapUp.
	Athlete hereby acknowledges and agrees that DapUp shall be the sole owner of all right title and
	interest in and to any and all Athlete Content and all intellectual property rights therein or
	related thereto. Athlete hereby grants, assigns, and transfers to DapUp all present and future
	worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Athlete Content created, prepared, produced
	and/or distributed pursuant to a Campaign and this Agreement, and all intellectual property
	rights, except that Athlete retains a limited license to display such Athlete Content on
	Athlete’s blog, social media accounts, in portfolios, and other self-promotion channels. As to
	any portion of the Athlete Content created after the execution of this Agreement, the assignment
	shall become eﬀective immediately upon creation thereof, without need for further consideration
	or written agreement among the parties. Athlete waives any and all moral rights in any Athlete
	Content in perpetuity. By way of example and not limitation, DapUp shall have the right to
	publish, repurpose, create derivative works of and further use the Athlete Content for any
	purpose without any further assignment, license or authorization and shall have the right to
	license and sublicense the Athlete Content at its discretion. Further, Athlete hereby grants to
	DapUp the nonexclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty free right and license
	to use, reproduce, modify, copy, publish, display and distribute Athlete’s name, nickname,
	username, likeness, image and photo in connection with the Athlete Content, in whole or in part,
	edited or otherwise modified, alone or with other materials, for the purpose of promoting DapUp,
	Business and/or the Campaign. Athlete is prohibited from modifying, removing, suppressing, or in
	any other way making inconspicuous the copyright, digital fingerprints, watermarks,
	identification labels, legal notices contained within the Content or other technical protection
	devices or data identifying DapUp or its licensors rights in the Content, its files or its
	components. If You believe that Your work has been used in a way that constitutes copyright
	infringement, or Your intellectual property rights have been otherwise infringed, please notify
	DapUp at info@dapup.co. We will review all claims of copyright infringement received and remove
